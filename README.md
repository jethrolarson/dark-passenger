Hi, 

Thanks for taking the time to check out the source of my game. 
You can feel free to use it to make your own game but please 
don't copy the text.

The content and scripting of the game is written in YAML, 
Markdown, and embedded js templates. I convert the YAML to 
JSON on the server and parse it out in the browser. I use the 
hashchange event to see when people click links and load 
sections of the content based on the URL. I'm not entirely 
pleased with how it works, but I'd never get this game 
shipped if kept building the engine.

I'd like to thank the people that helped me write,
edit, test, and define the world: 

Eddie Jefferson, Michael Gomez, Brandon Curtis, and my wife 
Arin Larson.
