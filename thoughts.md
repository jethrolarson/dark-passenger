Need to make sure people feel like their choices matter early on. This can be done with a simple choice that has an obvious and irriversable affect.

Have the player make a seemingly inconsequential choice early on with strong emotional impact. This will make them feel like they are driving the story. If people feel they made the wrong choice they'll use the back button; however since I hijack the back button and store state in localStorage their choices are permanent.

Don't let the story prevent interaction from happening.

Should I use keywords to draw attention to things?

Should I make it clear when an action affected the state.

Setting
1700s ish 

Post Imperial port city on relatively small island
Natives, slaves, freed slaves, pirates, imperials, missionaries
