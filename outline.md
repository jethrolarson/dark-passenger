Outline (Spoiler Alert)
=======================

You are Bill Decker, a skeptic veterinarian operating in the hillbilly town of Bolt Creek. At the insistence of the locals you performed a ritual exorcism on rabid pig. Unfortunately the possession was real and the ritual backfires. Now you are inhabited by an chaotic spirit that wants out just as much as you do. Neither of you really know what has forced the binding. A flood has washed out the roads leaving you stranded. In the meantime you help people with all the weird shit that continues. Your curse grants you insight into the spirit world but every effort to help people with these strange events sacrifices more of your humanity.
