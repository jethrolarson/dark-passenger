  The family sleeps together in this small room. There's bedrolls on the floor, and writings hanging on the wall, presumably from some religious text.

  There's a portrait on the wall of some ancestor, it's very old. The painting seems to look at you.
  EXAMINE shows close up and VIEW BACK option. The back shows the back of the person. There is otherwise nothing special.

  There's a small table on one side of the room. On it is some incense that you can pick up. DP says he hates jasmine as you pick it up. Obove the table is a mirror facing the door. EXAMINE Shows the reflection. In it is a strange doll with a damaged arm. You can grab the doll through the mirror.
