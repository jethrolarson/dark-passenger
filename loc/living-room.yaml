    The morning sun gave me hope that today would be warm, but there's no 
    comfort to be found in this little peasants home. 
    [Whispers of wind](#living-room/whispers) seem to creak through the 
    house but the air is still, hanging with a 
    [thick stench](#living-room/smell).
  
    A hazy beam of bluish light shines from the 
    [open window](#living-room/shutters) on the [wreckage](#living-room/wreckage) of 
    last night's incident.
    
    <%if(cache.father_in_living_room){%>
    The father, [hiro](#living-room/hiro), stands near the door.

shutters: 
  title: Shutters
  content: | 
    The shutters have been thrown wide to let in the morning light but in 
    here the sun shines as through smoked glass. [Shadows](#shadows) seem to flicker as 
    if cast from some unseen candle and clouds of gnats dance in the 
    smokey sunbeam.
  
wreckage: 
  title: Wreckage
  content: |
    Straw mats, tables, pillows, and dishes are strewn about the living room. 
    "What a mess." I look around the chaos. "I'm guessing the incident 
    happened at dinner time?"
    
    "Yes. Just before sunset yesterday." Hiro answers. <% cache.father_in_living_room = true; game.render(); %>
  
smell: 
  title: Stench
  content: |
    The house reeks of blood, sweat, and rot. There's a hint of some 
    incense that's tried to fight it, but it's obviously losing the battle.
  
whispers:

    The whispers almost sound like voices but I can't make out what 
    they're saying. Whatever it is, it definately isn't nice.
     
hiro:
  title: Hiro
  content: |
    Hiro came to me late last night claiming that his daughter was possessed.   
    This seems to be the default diagnosis for every malady on Mue. 
    The last "possession" I had to deal with turned out to be chicken pox. 
    Still, his daughter had bit him on the neck and that's more than enough 
    to warrant an examination. 6 hours later he's still holding a 
    [bloody rag](#living-room/hiro/bloody-rag) against the wound.
    
  "bloody-rag":

        The blood hass a yellowish tinge like iodine, but I really doubt 
        that it is.
      - | 
        "How you holding up?" I ask.
      - |
        "Not well. The bleeding hasn't stopped." A pained, exhausted 
        look crosses his face as he glances toward the rag.
      - |
        `Oh wow, the yellowing, I'm so excited. He'll be so much fun 
        when darkness falls.`
      - |
        "Oh? What happens then?" I ask.
      - |
        Hiro gives me a grave look. I keep forgetting that no one else can 
        hear Jin.
        "I guess eventually I'll die. Maybe you would like to 
        [take a look at it](#living-room/hiro/wound)?" Hiro asks in an 
        sarcastic way.

        I nod and step forward. As I approach him I realize where the smell 
        of rot is coming from. It's like a combination of beached whale 
        and tooth decay. I choke back the urge to vomit making a weak 
        attempt to hold my breath.

'support-beam': 
  title: Support Beam
  content: | 
    There's a central support where the girl is tied.

    There are scratches around the base of the pole where the girl has been
    trying to get free and blood has soaked into the wood. She calls out 
    every once in a while with alternately heart-wrenching pleading and 
    disturbing threats. Occasionally strange things occur like fog along 
    the ground or insects, birds, and snakes coming in.
