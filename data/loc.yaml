    This morning I saw an angry merchant mutter an incantation at a beligerant ronin. It's a blessing that few people know any real curses. Anyone that's actually been cursed wouldn't wish one on their worst enemies. I know I wouldn't.

'living-room': 
  title: Living Room
  content: |
    The morning sun gave me hope that today would be warm, but there's no 
    comfort to be found in this little peasants home. 
    [Whispers of wind](#living-room/whispers) seem to creak through the 
    house but the air is still, hanging with a 
    [thick stench](#living-room/smell).
  
    A hazy beam of bluish light shines from the 
    [open window](#living-room/shutters) on the [wreckage](#living-room/wreckage) of 
    last night's incident.
    
    <%if(cache.father_in_living_room==="true"){%>
    The father, [hiro](#living-room/hiro), stands near the door.
    <%}%>
  
  shutters: 
    title: Open window
    content: | 
      The shutters have been thrown wide to let in the morning light but in 
      here the sun shines as through smoked glass. Shadows seem to flicker as 
      if cast from some unseen candle and a cloud of gnats dance in the 
      smokey sunbeam.
  
  wreckage: 
    title: Wreckage
    content: |
      Straw mats, tables, pillows, and dishes are strewn about the living room. 
      "What a mess." I look around the chaos. "I'm guessing the incident 
      happened at dinner time?"
    
      "Yes. Just before sunset yesterday." [Hiro](/#living-room/hiro) answers. <% cache.father_in_living_room = "true"; game.location.render(); %>
  
  smell: 
    title: Stench
    content: |
      The house reeks of blood, sweat, and rot. There's a hint of some 
      incense that's tried to fight it, but it's obviously losing the battle.
  
  whispers:
    content: |
      The whispers almost sound like voices but I can't make out what 
      they're saying. Whatever it is, it definately isn't nice.
     
  hiro:
    title: Hiro
    content: |
      Hiro came to me late last night claiming that his daughter was possessed.
      This seems to be the default diagnosis for every malady on Mue.<%cache.mue_on="true";%> 
      The last "possession" I had to deal with turned out to be chicken pox.
     
      Still, his daughter had bit him on the neck and that's more than enough 
      to warrant an examination. 6 hours later he's still holding a 
      [bloody rag](#living-room/hiro/bloody-rag) against the wound.
    
    "bloody-rag":
      title: Bloody Rag
      content: |
        The blood hass a yellowish tinge like iodine, but I really doubt 
        that it is.
      
        <%if(cache.bloody_rag_examined==="true"){%>
        Jin thinks the yellowing has started, whatever that means.
        <%}else{cache.bloody_rag_examined = "true";%>
        "How you holding up?" I ask.
    
        "Not well. I can't stop the bleeding." A pained, exhausted 
        look crosses his face as he glances toward the rag.
    
        "`Oh wow, the yellowing, I'm so excited. He'll be lots of fun 
        tonight.`", Jin says
    
        "Oh? What happens then?" I ask.
    
        Hiro gives me a confused look. I keep forgetting that no one else can 
        hear Jin.
        "I guess eventually I'll die," Hiro says. Jin laughs in my head. "Maybe you would like to 
        [take a look at it](#living-room/hiro/wound)?" Hiro asks in a 
        sarcastic way.
      
        <%}%>
    wound: 
      content: |
        I nod and step forward. As I approach him I realize where the smell 
        of rot is coming from. It's like a combination of dead horse 
        and tooth decay. I choke back the urge to vomit and make a weak 
        attempt to hold my breath. 
      
        Hiro pulls the rag off the wound. I flinch and almost try to stop him but then I'm hit with the sight of it. A fist sized area of his neck is just meat, and not good meat. It's like some kind of abominable afterbirth, veiny and raw. It's actively weeping the strange iodine-like fluid. 
      
        Should I take a sample, or [ask Jin](#living-room/hiro/wound/jin)?
      
      jin: 
        content: |
          "Lord what are we dealing with here?" I ask, directing my question at Jin.

      There's a central support where the girl is tied.

      There are scratches around the base of the pole where the girl has been
      trying to get free and blood has soaked into the wood.

      Hiro: 
      So?
      
      BILL
      Huh?
      
      Hiro:
      Can you help her?
      The little girl's clothes are shredded. Her sleves are caked in dirt and blood. She's growling and screeching in tongues. has crazy eyes, jagged teeth and sharpened claws.

    girl: |
      "Let me get a closer look." I say. I approach and bend down.
      I'd seen people go crazy before so I'm not too worried. She seems 
      [pretty calm](?q=examine-girl) at the moment.

    'examine-girl': |
      I reach toward her. Zoom to her face. Her eyes go crazy. She looses a hand and claws at Bill, scratching the back of his hand.

      Bill jumps back, grabs his hand. The Hiro: dives on the girls arm ad manages to retie it.

      DARK PASSENGER(DP)
      HAHAHAHA! I told you this wasn't mundane.

      BILL
      Insanity doesn't mean she's possessed. We haven't ruled out rabies.

      Hiro:
      What are rabies?

      BILL
      It's a ailment caused by...animal bites.

      DP
      You're going to want sake.

      BILL
      Why? It's not even noon yet

      DP
      For your hand.

      BILL
      It's just a scratch--
      We see POV of his hand, a little black bubble is there.

      Bill pokes it and it erupts with a hundred black baby spiders. They pour down his arm and fall to the floor in a mess if tiny webs. He screams and tries to shake them off. The girl screeches with evil laughter.

      BILL
      Sake! Please!

      Hiro dashes out of the room. Comes back with a ceramic bottle and unstops it. Bill takes a big chug and chokes.

      DP
      No, on your hand, moron.

      Bill pours a bunch on his wound and winces at sting.

      DP
      Though I don't mind the sake.

      After a few seconds of heavy breathing he takes another swig from the bottle, then sighs. The spiders have disappeared.

      BILL
      Alright, you have my...attention.

      DP
      Well, look around, we don't know anything about this demon yet.
      
bedroom:
  content: |
    The family sleeps together in this small room. There's bedrolls on the floor, and writings hanging on the wall, presumably from some religious text.

    There's a portrait on the wall of some ancestor, it's very old. The painting seems to look at you.
    EXAMINE shows close up and VIEW BACK option. The back shows the back of the person. There is otherwise nothing special.

    There's a small table on one side of the room. On it is some incense that you can pick up. DP says he hates jasmine as you pick it up. Obove the table is a mirror facing the door. EXAMINE Shows the reflection. In it is a strange doll with a damaged arm. You can grab the doll through the mirror.
